### Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering 
The selected artifact for this milestone is a 3D OpenGL cosmetic scene that was developed during my CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization course in May 2025. The scene was designed to replicate a real-life cosmetic display which included 3D representation of items such as a perfume bottle, mascara tube, lotion container, and eyeshadow palette. The scene also included a vertical backdrop plane and a floor plane to complete the display environment. Each object was created using basic geometric primitives such as cones, cylinders, spheres, and boxes.  To enhance realism, loaded custom shader textures were applied to the objects and enhanced using a texture UV scale and shader material.  The scene used directional and point lights for realistic illumination and included full camera navigation using mouse and keyboard inputs to allow interactive exploration of the 3D environment. 
	This artifact was selected for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a broad range of software engineering and design skills, including 3D modeling, texture mapping, shader application, lighting configuration, and interactive camera control.  This project reflects my ability to use OpenGL and C++ to build a visually rich and interactive 3D environment that adheres to core design principles such as realism, modularity, and visual hierarchy. 
	
This artifact showcases my ability to: 
•	Apply graphics programming techniques such as UV scaling and texture mapping to dynamically load and display surface materials. 

•	Configure lighting systems using directional and point light sources to simulate realistic scene illumination through program shaders. 

•	Implement real-time user input handling to enable camera control navigation following event-driven design. 

•	Design and organize modular code architecture by encapsulating rendering, transformation, and interaction logic into reusable object-oriented classes. 

This artifact was improved by adding functionality to toggle between two backdrop textures using keyboard input.  While I was able to implement the conditional logic, the enhancement had some limitations due to the fact that SNHU-provided starter files did not include access to the fragment shader, which would normally allow full runtime texture changes. Despite the limitation, the enhancement adds interactivity and demonstrates how user input can be applied to influence rendering behavior. 
	This artifact aligns with the course outcomes identified in my Module One plan, particularly Course Outcomes Two and Four. The enhancement work required designing, coding, and testing additional runtime interactivity that supports texture switching based on user input.  This directly reflects Course Outcome Two, as I applied professional, quality C++ and OpenGL practices to deliver a technically sound and visually coherent solution.  My attention to modular design, clarity of logic, and effective documentation supports communication of both technical and visual intent. 
	
	The project also demonstrates Course Four by integrating well-founded software engineering techniques such as shader management, keyboard input handling, and scene rendering logic.  I implemented runtime conditions, updated scene logic to react dynamically to user interaction, and thoroughly tested these changes in a controlled environment.  These are skills aligned with real-world development workflows and industry-specific practices. 
	
	While there was difficulty with the toggle feature displaying visibly during runtime due to rendering constraints in the school’s preloaded code, the supporting structure was successfully integrated into the codebase.  The enhancement strengthened the system’s design and demonstrated iterative development, thoughtful debugging, and implementation planning consistent with professional standards. No updates are needed to my original outcome coverage plan. 
	Enhancing this artifact provided a valuable opportunity to apply iterative development, code review, and debugging practices within a familiar but expanded codebase. While the original project demonstrated static rendering and navigation, the enhancement introduced a new layer of interactivity and runtime logic, deepening my understanding of how user input can dynamically influence scene behavior. 
	A key lesson I learned was the importance of planning enhancements that integrate cleanly into existing architecture.  I carefully reviewed the original object initialization, rendering functionality, and input handling system to determine the most efficient way to implement the texture logic without disrupting other features.  This reinforced my skills in modular design and scene management, as I structured the toggle feature using conditionals and flags that remained isolated from unrelated systems.	
	Throughout the process, I encountered challenges in verifying rendering behavior, particularly when the texture toggle would not visibly update as expected.  Rather than rewriting core rendering logic, I focused on confirming that all toggle conditions and function calls executed correctly.  This process emphasized the importance of debugging, where success is measured by logic and execution.  Ultimately, the enhancement process sharpened my ability to reason through unfamiliar rendering behavior, isolate potential problem areas, and implement changes in a structured, testable manner.  These are essential skills for real-world software development.
